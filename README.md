## About Simon game clone Project
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The device produces a series of tones and lights that the user must repeat. If the user is successful, the sequence lengthens and becomes more complicated. When the user fails or the time limit expires, the game is ended.

Using Pure JavaScript, I attempted and succeeded in creating this functionality. I learnt how to manipulate the DOM and use JavaScript methods, which helped me improve my JavaScript understanding.

## How the game works
The various buttons produce a series of tones and flickers that you must repeat. With each successful attempt, the pattern becomes more complex, and you are expected to repeat it. When you fail the pattern, the game is over and you must restart the website.
